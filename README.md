# What Is Parasite SEO?
Parasite SEO is an advanced search engine optimization strategy where individuals or businesses publish content on high-authority third-party websites (such as Medium, LinkedIn, or Reddit) to leverage their established domain authority and achieve higher rankings in search engine results pages (SERPs). By "piggybacking" on these reputable platforms, marketers can bypass the time-consuming process of building their own site's authority, gaining visibility and traffic more rapidly.
